There are many different debate formats that are used around the world. The one we use at Tampere Debate Society use is British Parliamentary format (BP), sometimes also called the WUDC format (World Universities Debate Championship), and it is also the format used in many competitions globally. 

There are many detailed guides to the BP format you may find on the internet and as a matter fact we made our own to help newcomers!

## The Format 

There are many different debate formats that are used around the world. The one we use at UTA Debate Society use is British Parliamentary format (BP), sometimes also called the WUDC format (World Universities Debate Championship), and it is also the format used in many competitions globally. 

There are very many detailed guides to the BP format you may find on the internet, but here is a brief overview: 
A motion for the debate (e.g. “This house would legalize cannabis” or “This house believes that everyone should have the right to public nudity”) 

Eight debaters divided into four teams; two teams for the motion, two teams against it

15 minutes of preparation time

Everyone gets to give one 7-minute speech to present their arguments, with the two sides taking turns 

Questions or Points of Information can be offered to the speaker after the first and before the last minute of their speech, with the possibility to accept or decline the question 

Every speaker has a particular role they need to fulfill in the debate

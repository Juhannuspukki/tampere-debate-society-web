Just come to a meeting and say hi! You do not need previous debating experience or anything like that; we will teach you the basics.
Becoming a member proper is also simple. The first 2-3 times are free, so you can find out if Tampere Debate Society is for you. After that you just need to pay the membership fee (5 euros), which officially makes you a member for a year.

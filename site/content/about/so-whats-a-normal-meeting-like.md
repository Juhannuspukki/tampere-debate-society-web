This can vary week from week, but our schedule is usually like this. Keep in mind that these times tend to be flexible.<br>
17.00-18.00 Debating practice, presentation or discussion.<br>
18.00- 19.30 Debating + feedback/discussion<br>
19.30 -> Moving on the Pub O’ Connell’s for further discussion and a few cold ones

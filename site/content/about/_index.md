# About us<br><br>

## What is UTA Debate Society?
We are a Tampere University based student organization that specializes in debating. We meet every Tuesday at 17.00 at PinniB, room number 5078.

Debating is an interesting and engaging activity which helps you improve your speaking and argumentation skills. If you want to learn more about debating, check out the debating tab on our site. This should help you understand it further.<br><br>




## Who can join the debate society?
The society mostly consists of students, but non-students are welcome as well. There is no need for registering or signing up beforehand either, so you can just walk in to a meeting if you are interested.<br><br>




## How can I join?
Just come to a meeting and say hi! You do not need previous debating experience or anything like that; we will teach you the basics.

Becoming a member proper is also simple. The first 2-3 times are free, so you can find out if UTA Debate Society is for you. After that you just need to pay the membership fee (5 euros), which officially makes you a member for a year.<br><br>




## So what’s a normal meeting like for the debate society?
This can vary week from week, but our schedule is usually like this. Keep in mind that these times tend to be flexible.

17.00-18.00 Debating practice, presentation or discussion.<br>
18.00- 19.30 Debating + feedback/discussion<br>
19.30 -> Moving on the Pub O’ Connell’s for further discussion and a few cold ones<br><br>

  The society mostly consists of students, but non-students are welcome as well.

    icon: fa-users
    content: >-
      We are a Tampere University based student organization that specializes in
      debating. We meet every Tuesday at 17.00 at PinniB, room number
      5078.<br><br> Debating is an interesting and engaging activity which helps
      you improve your speaking and argumentation skills. If you want to learn
      more about debating, check out the debating tab on our site. This should
      help you understand it further.

      Just come to a meeting and say hi! You do not need previous debating
      experience or anything like that; we will teach you the basics. Becoming a
      member proper is also simple. The first 2-3 times are free, so you can
      find out if Tampere Debate Society is for you. After that you just need to
      pay the membership fee (5 euros), which officially makes you a member for
      a year.
